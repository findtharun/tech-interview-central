|---------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Faster Query Performance**: Indexes significantly speed up data retrieval operations by reducing the amount of data the database needs to scan. | **Increased Storage Requirements**: Indexes take up additional disk space, which can be significant for large tables. |
| **Efficient Sorting and Ordering**: Queries that involve `ORDER BY`, `GROUP BY`, or `JOIN` clauses can benefit from indexes, as they help reduce the amount of sorting required. | **Slower Insert, Update, and Delete Operations**: Maintaining indexes during data modifications (insert, update, delete) can slow down these operations because the index itself needs to be updated. |
| **Improved Search Efficiency**: Particularly useful for large tables, where a well-chosen index can drastically reduce search times. | **Index Fragmentation**: Over time, as data changes, indexes can become fragmented, leading to degraded performance and the need for reindexing. |
| **Facilitates Quick Lookups**: By reducing the need for full table scans, indexes allow quick access to rows in large databases. | **Complexity in Index Management**: Improper indexing or over-indexing can lead to performance degradation and increased maintenance costs. |
| **Optimized Performance for Specific Queries**: Indexes can be designed for common queries, making repeated queries faster. | **Not Always Beneficial for Small Tables**: On smaller tables, the performance improvement from an index might be negligible and could even add unnecessary complexity. |
| **Reduced Disk I/O**: Indexes reduce the number of disk accesses required for a query by providing direct access paths. | **Risk of Unused Indexes**: If indexes are not used frequently, they just add overhead without providing performance benefits. |
| **Supports Unique Constraints**: Indexes are used to enforce constraints like `UNIQUE` and `PRIMARY KEY`, ensuring data integrity. | **Requires Rebuilding**: In some cases, indexes may need to be rebuilt or reorganized periodically to maintain their effectiveness. |
