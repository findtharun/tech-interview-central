## Method Overloading

Method / Function Overloading is about 2 Things

- Various Data Types of Parameters in Same function
- No.of Arguments

### Java vs Python

Python does not support method overloading by default, but we can implement easily.

- In terms of Data Types : It defats whole purpose of python where it is dynamic type
- In terms of No.of Arguments
  - Python Supports (*args) which can be used to implement Overloading
  - We can also Implement Default Variable value as None and Implement overloading.
