Serialization

Serialization is the process of converting an object into a stream of bytes to store the object or transmit it to memory, a file, or over a network. Its main purpose is to save the state of an object in order to recreate it when needed. 
The reverse process is called deserialization â€” converting byte data back into an object.

Approaches for Serialization in Java:
- Using Serializable Interface
-  Using Externalizable Interface (Better approach when customization is needed)
