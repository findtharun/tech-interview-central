A generator function in Python is defined like a normal function, but whenever it needs to generate a value, it does so with the yield keyword rather than return. Lazy Loading meaning they generate values on-the-fly and only when requested

They enable you to iterate over data without loading the entire dataset into memory, making them particularly useful for working with large datasets, streams, and real-time data processing.

They are memory efficient and execute faster.
