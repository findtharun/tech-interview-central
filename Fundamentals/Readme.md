## Variables

Local / Instance , Class, Static, Global

## Java vs Python

- Java does not have the concept of Global, closest one to that is static.
- Static variables are private in general, can be accessed by all methods of class but not by other classes.
- Static variables can be accessed by other classes. Public staic datatype is equivalent to Global in java.

- Python do not have concept of static, class variables are equivalent to static variables.
- Python supports global variables, it variable is global only within the module where it is defined. To access it across different modules, import the module containing the global variable.

## Methods

## First Class Objects

A first-class object in programming is an entity that can be:

- Passed as an argument to a function.
- Returned from a function.
- Assigned to a variable.
- Stored in data structures.

### Java vs Python

- In Python, Functions and Classes are First Class Objects. Java does not support Functions/Classes as First Class Objects.
